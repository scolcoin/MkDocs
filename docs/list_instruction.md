## FAQ about Listing  Tokens

###  Which trading pair can be listed?

Simply allowing trading between two assets seems easy enough, however it is expensive for not only the network  but also its users in long term (and liquidity costs can be much larger). In order to efficiently use the network, ScolCoin Chain only list assets against SCOL and other widely accepted market quote assets.

### How is a trading pair created on SCOL DEX?

The design philosophy of SCOL DEX adheres to the idea that the most efficient and low cost way to perform trading and price-discovery is still to use single order book. This single order book is managed and replicated across all full nodes with the same, deterministic matching logic.
