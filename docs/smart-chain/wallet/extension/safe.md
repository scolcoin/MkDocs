# How to stay safe

Wallets are a bit of a shift in thinking. Financial freedom and the ability to access and use funds anywhere comes with a bit of responsibility – there’s no customer support in crypto.


## Take responsibility for your own funds

Centralized exchanges will link your wallet to a username and password that you can recover in a traditional way. Just remember you’re trusting that exchange with custody over your funds. If that company is attacked or folds, your funds are at risk.


## Write down your seed phrase

Wallets will often give you a seed phrase that you must write down somewhere safe. This is the only way you’ll be able to recover your wallet.

Here's an example:
```
there aeroplane curve vent formation doge possible product distinct under spirit lamp
```
Don’t store it on a computer. Write it down and keep it safe.


## Do Your Own Research

If you use a web wallet, bookmark the site to protect yourself against phishing scams.

Remember transactions can’t be reversed and wallets can’t be easily recovered so take care.
