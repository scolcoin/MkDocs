# Cross Chain Communication

## Architecture

A native cross chain communication protocol is developed between BC (ScolCoin Chain) and SCOL (SCOL Side Chain). It has the following key parts:

* [Build-in System Contract](system-contract.md)
* [Oracle on ScolCoin Chain](oracle-module.md)
* [NCRelayer](nc-relayer.md)
* [NCRelayer Incentive Mechanism](incentives.md)
* [Oracle Relayer](oracle-relayer.md)
