# BEP89

> Note: this feature is only available in Testnet after Lagrange Upgrade.


## Motivations

ScolCoin Chain will have some hard forks inevitably in the long run. When different valdiator nodes use different version of SCOL Chains codebase either unintentionally or as a result of an attack, it may lead to a consensus fork or a chain split. By far the vast majority of changes to the ScolCoin Chain codebase have no impact on consensus rules. Note that this type of fork is very different than a codebase fork (usually done by cloning someone else’s repository).

When a change is proposed that affects compatibility with other nodes, a BEP (SCOL Evolution Proposal) is typically required. A brief description of the BEP process along with a list of existing BEPs can be found [here](https://github.com/githubusername/githubrepo/BEPs).

[BEP89](https://github.com/githubusername/githubrepo/BEPs/blob/master/BEP89.md) is introduced to enable the chain to display the whole view of validators that on different upcoming forks. Any nodes/validators can decide to upgrade/fork or not accordingly. ScolCoin Chain full nodes are able to display the whole view of validators that on different upcoming forks.



## Implementatiion


The proposal `FORK_HASH` takes an "IEEE CRC32 checksum ([4]byte) of the genesis hash + fork blocks numbers that already passed. Validator nodes will fill in `Header.Extra` with `NEXT_FORK_HASH` during preparing block header.

The fullnodes will log a warning message if the majority `NEXT_FORK_HASH` is different from local.

Example log of warning:

```
t=2021-01-20T21:40:09+0800 lvl=warn msg="there is a possible fork, and your client is not the majority. Please check..." nextForkHash=cd0d163d

```
