# Buy SCOL as Gas

!!! Tip
	    This feature is available in v2


## Why do we need this feature?

When users swap their tokens to the SRC20 equivalents on ScolCoin Chain, they also need to get some SCOL to pay for gas.

## Requirements

* The destination network has to be **ScolCoin Chain**
* The token is a popular BToken, such as BTC, ETH, USDT, BUSD
* The total of your swap order has to be greater than **2SCOL**

### How many SCOL you can get?

There are 3 options: 0.5 SCOL, 1SCOL and 2 SCOL

## User Guide

The network fee should be the sum of the fee for swapping assets and the fee for purchasing SCOL on your behalf.


!!! Tip
		The network fees are floating, you might get a different rate than you expected when your order is completed.


The actual amount of network fee you have to pay is **network fee\*(1-discount\)** When the discount is 100%, the network fee is free.

### 5. Complete the deposit transaction by sending the exact amount of token to the address shown

Calculation formula:

Received token  = Input amount  - network fee - cost to buy SCOL
