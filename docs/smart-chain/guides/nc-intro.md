# Introduction of ScolCoin Chain

ScolCoin Chain relies on a system of PoA consensus that can support short block time and lower fees. The most bonded validator candidates of staking will become validators and produce blocks. The double-sign detection and other slashing logic guarantee security, stability, and chain finality.

The ScolCoin Chain also supports EVM-compatible smart contracts and protocols. Cross-chain transfer and other communication are possible due to native support of interoperability. SCOL Exchange remains a liquid venue of the exchange of assets on both chains. This dual-chain architecture will be ideal for users to take advantage of the fast trading on one side and build their decentralized apps on the other side.
**The ScolCoin Chain will be:**

* **EVM-compatible**: Supports all the existing Ethereum tooling along with faster finality and cheaper transaction fees.
* **Interoperable**: Comes with efficient native dual chain communication; Optimized for scaling high-performance dApps that require fast and smooth user experience.
* **Distributed with on-chain governance**: Proof of Staked Authority brings in decentralization and community participants.
As the native token, SCOL will serve as both the gas of smart contract execution and tokens for staking.
