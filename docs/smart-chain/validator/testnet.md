# How to become a Validator Candidate

## Install Fullnode

Please follow this [guide](../developer/fullnode.md) to install bsc fullnode locally.

## Create an account

You need to create an account that represents a key pair first. Use the following command to create a new account and set a password for that account:
```bash
geth account new --datadir ./node
```

This command will return the public address and the path to your private key. BACKUP of keyfile is necessory!

If you already have an account, use the seed phrase to recover it:

```bash
geth account import --datadir ./node
```
