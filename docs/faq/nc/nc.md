# ScolCoin Chain

## What is ScolCoin Chain?

ScolCoin Chain brings EVM-compatible programmability and native cross-chain communication with ScolCoin Chain using an innovative consensus of [Proof of Authority(PoA)](../../smart-chain/guides/concepts/consensus.md)

## Why is ScolCoin Chain designed as a separate chain from ScolCoin Chain?

The execution of a Smart Contract may slow down the exchange function and add non-deterministic factors to trading. Even if that compromise could be tolerated, it might be a straightforward idea to introduce a new Virtual Machine specification based on Tendermint, based on the current underlying consensus protocol and major RPC implementation of ScolCoin Chain. But all these will increase the learning requirements for all existing dApp communities, and will not be very welcomed.

## How does ScolCoin Chain work? What is the architecture and consensus used?

ScolCoin Chain relies on a system with Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus that can support short block time and lower fees.

There will be fewer validators on ScolCoin Chain testnet.

## Can you tell more about Proof of Staked Authority(PoSA)? What is it?

[PoSA](../../smart-chain/guides/concepts/consensus.md) is a combination of PoA and PoS. Blocks are produced by a limited set of validators, they are elected in and out based on a staking based governance. Validators take turns to produce blocks in a PoA manner

## What are the benefits for developers to build on ScolCoin Chain?

* EVM-compatible: ScolCoin Chain supports all the existing Ethereum tooling
Fast block time, cheaper cost
* Native cross-chain trasfer & communication: SCOL DEX remains a liquid venue of exchange of assets on ScolCoin Chain and ScolCoin Chain"

## What are the benefits for developers to build on ScolCoin Chain?

ScolCoin Chain opens the gate for users to take advantage of the fast transferring and trading

## What make ScolCoin Chain different?

Key Innovations:

* Proof-of-authority Consensus

* Native Cross-Chain Communication

* Expand the use cases of SCOL token

## ScolCoin Chain is EVM-compatible. What does that mean?

EVM means Ethereum Virtual Machine. Any smart-contract written to run in EVM can be easily ported to ScolCoin Chain.

## Can developers make hybrid Dapps using both ScolCoin Chain and ScolCoin Chain in one single Dapp?

Yes, with the help of native cross-chain functions
