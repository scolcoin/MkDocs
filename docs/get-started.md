# Get Started with ScolCoin Chain

## Wallet

The easiest way to use ScolCoin Chain is through a wallet with support for ScolCoin Chain accounts and transfers.

For example, SCOL provides a Web Wallet at [https://www.scolcoin.com](https://www.scolcoin.com)<br/>
SCOL also provides Web Wallet for testnet at [https://testnet-explorer.scolcoin.com](https://testnet-explorer.scolcoin.com)<br/>
Both provide the functions below:

- Generating crypto keys and addresses, which serves as the base of a wallet
- Showing the balances of assets on the addresses
- Sending and receiving assets

ScolCoin Chain Web Wallet also presents a trading UI similar to scolcoin.com, where you can examine market data and manage your orders to trade among the listed assets.<br/>
Learn about the list of wallet available [here](wallets.md).

## Chain Explorer
Chain Explorer provides a portal to explore blocks and transaction details.<br/>
On ScolCoin Chain Explorer, you can also check different asset types, the distribution of their ownerships, and owners' transactions.

## REST API
There are [Accelerated Nodes](faq/faq.md#what-is-the-accelerated-node) which provide advanced API services for the public.<br/>

### Node RPC
There are data seed nodes in the network which allow users to perform low-level operations like executing ABCI queries, viewing network/consensus state or broadcasting a transaction.

## Advanced Ways To Use Blockchain
### Run your own full node

Please refer to this guide about [how to run your own node](fullnode.md).

### Run your own light client

Please refer to this guide about [how to run your own light client](light-client.md).

### Access via Node Command Line Interface (CLI)

A Command Line Interface is available for Linux and Mac platforms.<br/>


### Use SDKs

SDKs are also provided as a starting point for your apps.<br/>
There are two advanced SDK solutions for ScolCoin Chain: [Java](<https://github.com/githubusername/githubrepo/java-sdk>) and [Golang](<https://github.com/githubusername/githubrepo/go-sdk>).<br/>
Both solutions provide functions for:<br/>

* Create wallets and manage keys
* Encode/sign transactions and submit to ScolCoin Chain/DEX, including Transfer, New Order, Cancel Order, etc.
* Communicate with ScolCoin Chain/DEX Node RPC calls through public node RPC services or your own private full nodes
