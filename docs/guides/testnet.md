# Testnet

The testnet is a test environment for ScolCoin Chain network, run by the ScolCoin Chain development community, which is open to developers.

The validators on the testnet are from development team.

You can connect a node to the testnet by downloading the [node binary](https://github.com/githubusername/githubrepo/node-binary/tree/master/fullnode/testnet/0.6.3-hotfix) to use this [configuration](https://github.com/githubusername/githubrepo/node-binary/tree/master/fullnode/testnet/0.6.3-hotfix/config).

There is also a [web wallet](https://testnet-explorer.scolcoin.com/en/) that can directly interact with the DEX. testnet.

## What is the testnet good for?
