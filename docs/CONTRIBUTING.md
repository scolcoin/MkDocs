# How to Contribute to ScolCoin Chain Documentations Project

Your contributions to the [ScolCoin Chain](https://www.scolcoin.com/) will help build a fast and secure decentralized digital asset exchange.

We want to make it as easy as possible to contribute changes that help the ScolCoin Chain grow and thrive. There are a few guidelines that we ask contributors to follow so that we can merge your changes quickly.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Create a GitHub issue for your contribution, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce if it is a bug.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

### Minor Changes

#### Documentation

For small changes to comments and documentation, it is not
always necessary to create a new GitHub issue. In this case, it is
appropriate to start the first line of a commit with 'doc' instead of
an issue number.

## Finding things to work on

The first place to start is always looking over the current GitHub issues for the project you are
interested in contributing to. Issues marked with [help wanted][help-wanted] are usually pretty self-contained and a good place to get started.

Of course, feel free to create a new issue if you think something needs to be added or fixed.


## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes and make sure all tests pass.
